            <p className="text-text-900 text-justify">I grew up in Paris and have been living in London for the past 5 years. I pursued an interdisciplinary degree for my Bachelor's, 
                which gave me my first introduction to programming through Java and Python. I quickly realised that I was passionate and had aptitudes, and continued to deepen my knowledge with online courses alongside my usual classes. In 2023, I decided to dedicate myself fully to the discipline, and began my Computer Science MSc at UCL.</p>
