I pursued an interdisciplinary degree for my Bachelor's, which gave me my first introduction to programming through Java and Python. I quickly realised that I was passionate and had aptitudes, and continued to deepen my knowledge with online courses alongside my usual classes. In 2023, I decided to dedicate myself fully to the discipline, and began my Computer Science MSc at UCL.",

The company was a small agency, and I promptly adapted to the fast-paced environment and learned how to balance delivering high-quality projects with meeting tight, ever-changing deadlines. As part of my role, I held weekly meetings with clients from Europe and Asia, which helped me improve my presentation skills and cultivate true professionalism.",
